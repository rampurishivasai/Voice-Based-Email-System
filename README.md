# Voice-Based-Email-System
Voice-based email systems enable users to compose and send emails using their voice instead of typing. 
# ABSTRACT
E-mail is the technology that enables user to contact with others by sending mails and also helps in business world communication. There are people who cannot use these technologies because either they lack knowledge or do not have the ability to see the screen. So, we proposed a Voice-based Email System using AI that will make the email system very easily accessible to visually challenged people and also help society. This voice-based email system will be containing new technologies that will help blind people to access e-mail and other multimedia functions. The users of this system don’t need to remember any basic information about keyboard shortcuts as well as location of the keys. Simple mouse click operations are needed for functions making system easy to use for user of any age group. We made use of Jupyter notebook/ Spyder and Python Frameworks.
